      "description": "The system uses a hybrid authentication approach to accommodate different client environments. Web clients authenticate via secure, httpOnly cookies to minimize XSS risks and leverage automatic credential handling by the browser, while mobile clients use JWT-based authentication with tokens stored securely and sent through Authorization headers due to the lack of automatic cookie management in mobile environments."

      "description": "To prevent duplicate order creation and the risk of double payments, write operations like order creation and payment initiation are designed to be idempotent using an idempotency key. Each order creation request includes a unique idempotency key generated on the client side. This approach protects the system from network retries, page refreshes, and duplicate submissions from users."
